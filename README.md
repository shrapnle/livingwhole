# The Living Whole Project

As an eater I can be part of a hopeful community that connects me to real world actions I can take in support of whole livingâ€“to nourish both myself and the living whole I am a part of. I can learn more about products while I shop and earn "points" that I can use to help my favorite products become more regenerative and to fund projects I believe in. Over time I also gain a better understanding of how I am in relationship with my health, community and the planet as whole.
